# TODO:

1.) Update harpoon stuff to use Telescope
2.) Document config better, it's still a mess
3.) Consider customizing UI (probably a very slow progression)
4.) Get cmp working
5.) Create project board for this config and my Linux config for more organized development
6.) Get reviews and thoughts from Reddit
7.) Look into Fused Telescope layout
